The native-messaging-example-host-file (see Chrome App [native messaging example] (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/api/nativeMessaging/host/), and also [this link] (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/nativeMessaging)) is modified in several alternative ways.  Each alternative is short and easy to follow, and a different Python module is used each time.  The aim is to produce code that is easily translated to other languages, and that is a good starting point for more complex applications.  

Note: All code was tested on Python 2.7.6, for 'little endian'.  (For 'big endian', pack the returned message's length with the zeros to the left instead).  For transparency, all code currently limits messages to size 0xFF.

----------------------

The following five files are alternatives to the 'native-messaging-example-host' file of the original Google example.  (Note: 'usingDecode' won't work with Python 3.)  Select the one you want to use, 
rename it 'native-messaging-example-host', and replace accordingly:

File usingStruct:  A skeletal version of the original native-messaging-example-host.  

File usingCodecs:  A version of native-messaging-example-host that uses the 'codecs' module.  Additionally, the message is saved to file.

File usingBinascii: A version of native-messaging-example-host that uses the 'binascii' module.

File usingBase64: A version of native-messaging-example-host that uses the 'base64' module. 

File usingDecode: This version is limited to Python 2.

----------------------

Folder 'App': The Google-provided example uses deprecated code.  I have therefore modified manifest.json and created background.js, so the example here is up-to-date.  This is a complete collection of the requred app files.

Folder 'Host':  For completeness, I have included the important host files from the example's link here, to cover for the eventuality that the link becomes broken.  These files are all totally unchanged from the original example.
Note that com.google.chrome.example.echo.json should be in ~/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts (or ~/.config/chromium/NativeMessagingHosts for Chromium), and the HOST_PATH should be modified to point to one of the 5 modifications.  Ensure that all file permissions are appropriate.
